They read “stay,” they read “it’s time.”

And so he was content, and so he stayed. 
20 And so he created a left, and so he made a right. 
And so he set boundaries, and so he made territories. 
22 And so he dredged gullies, and so ordered the fields; 
From the west to the east 
24 Everywhere he then took charge of affairs. 
The he summoned a Master of Construction; 
26 Then he summoned a Master of Labor. 
So that they could erect houses and homes. 
28 Their plumb lines ruled straight, 
They lashed together planks as earthen molds, 
30 To build an ancestral temple, reverent and respectful. 
Carrying the earth in crowds and multitudes, 
32 Throwing it into molds with clamors and shouts; 
Raising walls with a pounding beat, 
34 Smoothing them with a scraping sound. 
One hundred walls rose up together— 
36 The beating of the work drums could not keep up! 
So he created the outer gate soaring, 
38 Soaring the gate so high. 
So he erected the palace gate, 
40 The palace gate so grand. 
So he erected a great earthen shrine, 
42 Whereby to parade the Rong captives (in defeat). 
Tho’ over time he could not stop the enemy’s wrath, 
44 Still they did no harm to our reputation. 
He thinned the oaks, 
46 He cleared the roads,

He frightened away the Kun barbarians— 
48 Ah, how they panted in exhaustion. 
To cause the Yu and the Rui to pledge peace, 
50 King Wen quickened their yielding natures.

52 I say he drew those from front and back to him; 
I say he caused those with petitions to rush to him;

Who is it that keeps him on the isle? 
A lovely lady with delicate beauty, 
I move quickly on my cassia boat. 
5 I order the Yuan and Xiang to calm their waves, 
And command the Great River to ease its flow. 
I look out for my lord, but still he is not here, 
I play the reed pipes, but who is in my mind?

My sail is decorated with fig leaves and melilot,
Iris and orchid banners cover my flagpole. 
I gaze at the northern side of the Cen, far away, 
And wafting my magic I cross the Great River. 
15 Wafting my magic, I still have not reached him, 
My women are upset and heave deep sighs. 
My tears run down like small streams,
The thought of you makes me grieve. 
The cassia oars and orchid sweep on my boat 
20 Chip and knock at the ice and snow.
I pick fig leaves in the water, 
And pluck lotuses from the treetops.
Our hearts are different: all matchmaking is
Our love is not deep: it is easy to break. 
25 A stream dashes through the stone shallows, 
And the flying dragon hovers above. 
Unfaithful relations cause long bitterness, 
He broke our date, telling me that he had
no time. 
In the morning I race along the riverside, 
30 By the evening I halt my chariot at the north
bank. 
Birds are roosting on the rooftops, 
And waters are circling around the hall. 
I throw my jade ring into the river, 
And leave my pendant in the mouth of the Li.
35 I pick lavenders in the fragrant isle, 
And will give them to my women below. 
A lost moment cannot be regained, 
Let us now take our time and roam at ease."

Longingly I let my vision roam, heart heavy with grief. 
Gently the autumn wind wafts,

I look out into the misty distance, 
And observe the murmuring waters flow. 
Why are the deer eating in the courtyard? 
What are the water dragons doing by the riverside?

In the evening I cross the western shore. 
I seem to hear my love calling to me, 
So I will gallop aloft to ride by her.
I will build her a house in the water, 
20 And cover its roof with lotus leaves. 
I will use iris to paint its walls, purple shells to
decorate its court, 
And will spread perfumed peppers in its hall. 
Its beams will be made of cassia, rafters of orchid, 
The lintel of the peony room will be from lily trees. 
25 Woven fig leaves will be used for its curtains,
And melilot screens will be set up. 
White jade will be there to hold the mats, 
Thoroughworts will be placed to spread their scent. 
White sedges will cover the lotus room, 
30 Stalks of asarum will circle around it. 
A hundred sweet flowers will fill the courtyard 
To disperse their fragrance in the chambers and
hallways. 
The spirits of Jiuyi Mountain will all come out to
welcome us,
They will arrive in large throngs like clouds.

And leave my shirt in the mouth of the Li.
I pick lavenders in the fragrant isle,

Took omens to give me an auspicious name. 
The name he gave me was True Exemplar 
The title he gave me was Divine Balance.
Having from birth this inward beauty,

I dressed in selinea and shady angelica, 
And twined autumn orchids to make a garland. 
Swiftly I sped as in fearful pursuit, 
Afraid that time would race on and leave me behind. 
15 In the morning I gathered the angelica on the

In the evening I plucked the sedges of the islets. 
The days and months hurried on, never delaying,

335 I broke a branch of jasper to take for my meat,
And ground fine jasper meal for my journey’s provisions. 
Harness winged dragons to be my coursers, 
Let my chariot be of fine work of jade and ivory! 
How can I live with men whose hearts are strangers to me? 
340 I am going on a far journey to be away from them. 
I took the way toward the Kun-lun Mountain, 
A long, long road with many a turning in it. 
The cloud-embroidered banner flapped its great shade above us, 
And the jingling jade yoke-bells tinkled merrily. 
345 I set off at morning from the Ford of Heaven,
At evening I came to the world’s western end
Phoenixes followed me, bearing up my pennants, 
Soaring high with majestic wing-beats. 
Suddenly my route took me to the Flowing Sands, 
 Warily I drove along the banks of the Red Waters. 
Then, beckoning the water-dragon to make a bridge for me, 
I summoned the God of the West to take me over
So long the road had been and full of difficulties, 
I sent word to my escort to take another route, 
 To wheel around leftward, skirting Bu-zhou Mountain,
On the shore of the Western Sea we would reassemble. 
When we had mustered there, all thousand chariots, 
Jade hub to jade hub we galloped on abreast.
My eight dragon steeds flew on with writhing undulations, 
360 My cloud-embroidered banners flapped on the wind. 
In vain I tried to curb them, to slacken the swift pace, 
The spirits soared high up, far into the distance, 
We played the Nine Songs and danced to the Shao music,
Borrowing the time to make a holiday.
 But when I had ascended the splendor of the heavens, 
I suddenly caught a glimpse of my old home. 
My groom’s heart was heavy and the horses for longing 
Arched their heads back and refused to go on."

To its right is Western Limits;

The Purple Gulf intersects its north.
Here begin and end the Ba and Chan, 
Here exit and enter the Jing and Wei. 
The Feng, Hao, Lao, and Jue
Twisting and twining, sinuously snaking 
Crisscross within it. 
Vast and wide, the eight streams separately flow, 
Back to back, each in a different manner. 
East, west, south, and north, 
40 They gallop and dash hither and thither.
They emerge from gaps in steep hills, 
Run along the banks of holms and isles, the han dynasty
Pass through the middle of cinnamon groves, 
Cross into broad and boundless wastes. 
 Swiftly, amply flowing, 
They descend along the slopes, 
Enter mouths of narrow gorges, 
Collide with giant boulders,
Smash against winding shores, 
50 Frothing with violent anger. 
Soaring and leaping, surging and swelling, 
Spurting and spouting, rushing and racing, 
Pressing and pushing, clashing and colliding,
Flowing uncontrolled, bending back, 
55 Wheeling and rearing, beating and battering, 
Swelling and surging, troublous and turbulent. 
Loftily arching, billowing like clouds, 
Sinuously snaking, curling and coiling, 
Outracing their own waves, rushing to the chasms, 
60 Lap, lap, they descend to the shoals. 
Striking the bluffs, hurtling against the dikes, 
Racing and swelling, spraying and spuming. 
Nearing the sandbars, they pour into gullies, 
Plashing and splashing as they tumble downward. 
65 Deep, deep, full, full, 
Rumbling and roaring, bellowing and blustering, 
Bubbling and boiling, gushing and gurgling, 
Foaming and frothing like a seething cauldron, 
Speeding waves, flinging spray, 
70 They swiftly swirl, furious and fast. 
Far and wide, distantly heading homeward, 
Still and silent, without a sound, 
Gently, they make their long return. 
And then 
Broad and boundless, deep and wide, 
75 Calmly coursing, slowly turning, 
Brightly gleaming and glistening, 
Eastward they pour into great lakes, 
Spill and overflow into reservoirs and ponds. 
Thereupon, 
80 Scaly dragons and scarlet wiverns, 
Beaked sturgeons, crayfish, 
Striped fish, bighead carp, eels, yellow catfish, 
Fish-ox, flounders, 
Raising their dorsal fins, wiggling their tails, 
 Shaking their scales, flapping their fins, 
Dwell submerged in the deep recesses. 
Fish and turtles noisily sound forth; 
Myriad creatures throng in great numbers. 
Luminous moons and pearlets 
90 Gleam and glow on the riverbanks. 
Shu stone, yellow quartz, 
Rock crystal heaped high: 
Spangling and sparkling, glittering and glistening, 
Their colors and hues brightly shining, 
95 Are thickly gathered within them. 
Swan geese, kingfishers, swans, bustards, 
Wild geese, white herons, 
Night herons, revolving eyes,
Hornbills, dike ducks, 
 Needle beaks, and cormorants, 
Swim in flocks on the surface, 
Freely floating, wandering at will, 
Tossed and tumbled with the wind, 
Bobbing and rocking with the waves,

Nibbling at water grass and horsetail, 
Chewing caltrop and lotus. "

Steeply scarped, jaggedly jutting. 
Jiuzong rises sheer and sharp,

Their cliffs and ledges, like tottering cauldrons, 
Stand precipitously piled, jagged and steep 
Waters collect in streams, converge in gullies, 
Which twist and twine into cloughs and channels. 
Valley mouths widely gape and yawn, 
Mounds rise from the waters, each a separate isle. 
The hills, rugged and ragged, 
Hillocky and hummocky, rolling and rearing, 
Cragged and crannied, 
Rise and fall, wind and weave. 
Where the land slopes and slants, gradually
levels out, 
125 The waters stream forth in a flooding flow, 
Scattering and spreading over the level plain, 
For a thousand leagues of flat marshland, 
There is nothing that has not been tamped smooth. 
The ground is covered with green patchouli, 
 Blanketed with lovage shoots, 
Scattered with lovage leaves, 
Strewn with peonies,

Rich and redolent, sweetly-scented, 
And myriad perfumes issue forth, 
Spread and scatter, permeating everything,
Thick and heavy, strong and sharp. 
“And then, gazing round, broadly viewing, one sees such plenteous profusion, such a vast vista, he
becomes dizzy and dazed, confounded and confused.
 “Look at it, and it has no beginning; 
Examine it, and it has no end. 
The sun rises from its eastern pond, 
Sets at its western dike. 
To the south 
 In deepest winter there are germination and growth,

Plunging bull, sambar, elaphure
160 Redhead, roundhoof,

Detached palaces, separate lodges, 
Stretch over mountains, straddle valleys: 
170 Tall corridors pour out in four directions, 
With double decks and twisting passageways, 
Fitted with ornate rafters and jade finials, 
Carriage roads are laced and linked together. 
To course through the covered walkways, 
 Long is the route, and midway one must halt for the night. 
On leveled peaks they built the halls,
With tiered terraces rising story upon story, 
And cavernous rooms in the crags and crannies. 
Downward through deep darkness nothing can be seen, 
Upward, one may clutch rafters to touch the sky. 
Shooting stars pass through doors and wickets; 
Arching rainbows stretch over the rails and porches. 
A green dragon curls and coils in the eastern chamber, 
An elephant carriage twists and turns through the western repose, 
Hordes of immortals rest in the leisure lodges, 
Wo Quan and his kind sun themselves in the southern eaves,
Sweetwater springs bubble among the cool rooms, 
Spring-fed streams pass through the central courtyard. 
Giant boulders, lining the shores, 
 Like cragged cliffs sideward lean. 
Tall and towering, peaked and pinnacled, 
They seem carved and chiseled, steeply poised. 
Rose stone, prase, dark jade, 
And coral grow in clusters. 
Agate gems and large carnelians 
Are striped and streaked like patterned fish scales. 
Red jade, mottled and marbled, 
Are mixed and mingled among them. 
Morning iridescence, rounded and pointed jades, 
Mr. He’s jade come there. 
And then 
Black kumquats that ripen in summer, 
Yellow mandarins, coolie oranges, pomelos, 
Loquats, wild jujubes, persimmons, 
Wild pears, apples, magnolias, 
Date palms, box myrtles, 
Cherries, grapes, 
Dark poplars, dwarf cherries,
Plums and litchees 
Are spread among the rear palaces,
Form rows in the northern orchards, 
Stretch over hills and mounds, 
Descend to the level plain. 
They wave their emerald leaves, 
Sway their purple stalks, 
 Burst with red blossoms, 
Hang with vermilion blooms. 
Bright and brilliant, grand and glorious, 
They splendently sparkle in the vast fields. 
Apples, oaks, 
White birch, liquidambars, gingkos, sumacs, 
Pomegranates, coconuts, 
Betel palms, windmill palms, 
Sandalwoods, magnolias, 
Camphors, and wax trees: 
Grow a thousand yards tall, 
So wide only joined hands can span them. 
Their blossoms and branches unfolding straight, 
Their fruits and leaves lush and luxuriant. 
The trees stand in thickets, lean in clusters, 
230 Bent and bowed, clinging together, then
cleaving apart, 
Tangled and twined, twisted and gnarled, 
Locked as in combat, in layered limbs. 
Drooping branches spread and splay, 
Falling petals fly and flutter. 
235 Lush and luxuriant, closely clustered,
They swing and sway with the wind, 
Which sighs and soughs, whistles and whiffles, 
Like the sounds of bells and chimes, 
Or the music of pipes and flutes. 
 Tall and short, high and low, 
The trees surround the rear palaces. 
Manifoldly layered, piled one upon another, 
They blanket the mountains, hem the valleys, 
Follow the slopes, descend into the depressions. 
 Look at them, and there is no beginning; 
Examine them and there is no end. 
And then 
Black apes and white she-apes, 
Kahaus, hoolocks, flying squirrels, 
Dusky gibbons, monkeys, 
Macaques, weasels, and siamangs 
Roost and repose among the trees. 
With long howls and sad shrieks, 
Gracefully gliding, they cross back and forth, 
Bending and bowing on the branches and boughs, 
255 Hunched and hunkered on the treetops. 
They overleap unbridged streams, 
Spring to the top of sundry thickets. 
Clutching hanging twigs, 
Throwing themselves through open spaces. 
Sparsely scattered, helter-skelter, 
The troupe dissolves and disperses, receding into the distance. 
“Places of this sort number in the hundreds and thousands. The emperor sports and plays hither and
thither, and in whatever palace he spends the night or lodge where he rests, his kitchen need not be
transported, his harem need not be moved, and his official staff is ready and waiting."

barricade hunt.
 “He mounts a chariot of carved ivory, 
Drawn by six jade-encrusted dragon-steeds. 
Waving rainbow banners, 
Trailing cloud pennants, 
They march with the hide-covered wagon at the fore, 
 The guiding and excursion chariots in the rear. 
Elder Sun holds the reins, 
Sir Wei accompanies the chariot. 
Guards and attendants marching on the flank, 
Are chosen from the four brigades. 
To the drumbeats from the rigid ranks of the cortege, 
They unleash the hunters. 
The Yangtze and Yellow River are the corral, 
Mount Tai is the lookout tower. 
Chariots and riders thunderously set forth, 
285 Shake the heavens, move the earth, 
Front and rear, hither and thither, 
Scattered and dispersed, in separate pursuit; 
Steadily streaming, continuously coursing, 
They skirt along the mounds, follow the marshes, 
290 Spreading like clouds, showering like rain. 
They capture alive leopards and panthers, 
Pummel dholes and wolves, 
Hand-capture black and brown bears, 
Kick at wild goats. 
295 Capped in pheasant-tail hats,
Clad in white tiger skin pants, 
Garbed in striped pelts, 
Astride wild horses: 
They scale steeps of three-tiered peaks, 
300 Descend slopes of rocky ridges, 
Cut across defiles, dash into scarps, 
Traverse gullies, ford rivers. 
They maul the flying dragon-bird, 
Paw the sagacious stag, 
Wrestle a yeti, 
Spear a fierce tapir, 
Rope the graceful galloper, 
Shoot the giant boar. 
Arrows do not wantonly injure, 
They sever the neck, split the brain. 
Bows are not shot in vain, 
At the bowstring’s twang down a beast falls. 
And then the emperor 
Slackens the pace to wander about, 
Roam and ramble, going to and fro, 
315 To watch the movements of his regiments and
companies, 
To observe the changing poses of the
commanders. 
Fu Poetry: An Ancient-Style Rhapsody 69
Then, little by little he increases the pace, 
And suddenly he departs for the distance, 
Scattering fleet-winged birds, 
320 Trampling nimble beasts, 
Axles crushing albino deer, 
Snatching up nimble hares. 
Overtaking scarlet lightning, 
Leaving its effulgent brilliance behind, 
325 Pursuing strange beasts, 
He leaves the mundane realm. 
Bending the Fanruo bow, 
Drawn to the tip of the white-plumed shaft, 
He shoots the roving simian, 
330 Strikes the flying chimera. 
Carefully selecting a fleshy one, he then shoots, 
His first shot hits the spot he names. 
Just as the arrow leaves the string, 
The quarry is killed and falls to the ground. 
335 Then, raising the signal flag, he soars aloft, 
Outdistancing the startling wind
Passing through the frightful gale, 
Riding the empty void, 
Companion of the gods. 
340 He tramples the black crane, 
Confounds the great fowl, 
Harries the peacock and simurgh, 
Torments the golden pheasant, 
Strikes the canopy bird, 
345 Clubs the phoenix, 
Snatches the sea-argus, 
Seizes the blazing firebird. 
“At journey’s end, road’s limit, he wheels round his carriage and turns back.

350 “Slowly and leisurely he roams and rambles, 
And lands in the northern bounds. 
Rapidly he advances straight ahead, 
Suddenly he reverses direction. 
He treads Stone Gateway, 
355 Crosses Great Peak Tower, 
Passes Jaybird Tower, 
Gazes at Dewy Chill, 
Descends to Pear Palace,
Rests in Befitting Spring.
 Westward he gallops to Xuanqu, 
Sculls the heron-prow on Oxhead Lake, 
Climbs Dragon Terrace, 
Reposes at Lithe Willows.
He observes the effort and prowess of his officers and men, 
Evaluates the hunters’ catch. 
Those crushed and crumpled by foot soldiers and chariots, 
Those trampled and trod by infantry and cavalry, 
Those squashed and flattened by the multitudes, 
Together with those utterly and completely
exhausted and fatigued, 
In frightful panic, cowering in terror, 
Who died without a single wound, 
Heaped high, piled and pillowed, 
Clog the ditches, fill the gullies, 
Cover the plains, lie strewn over the marshes. "

Tired of excursion and sport,

Erect ten-thousand-catty bell-racks, 
380 Raise banners adorned with kingfisher tufts, 
Set in place drums of magic alligator hide.

Listen to songs of Getian.

Streams and valleys from this churn and billow. 
The music of Ba-Yu, Song, and Cai,

Soft and supple, gracile and graceful, 
Winning and winsome, slender and slight, 
Trail the hems of their pure silk gowns, 
Subtly flowing and falling, perfectly tailored. 
415 As they wheel and reel, whirl and twirl, 
Their garments seem not of this world. 
Their sweet fragrance, profusely permeating, 
Is strong and pungent, pure and thick. 
Their white teeth spangle and sparkle, 
420 Their bright smiles gleam and glitter. 
Beneath long eyebrows, coiling and curling, 
They coyly gaze, cast sidelong glances. 
Their beauty is offered, the spirit consents, 
And one’s heart rejoices to be at their side."

current and are reformed, spontaneously promote the Way and revert to morality. Punishments
are discarded and no longer are used. His virtue is loftier than that of the Three Kings, and his
achievements are more abundant than those of the Five Emperors. Only under these conditions can
hunting be enjoyed.

Tiring the spirit, straining the body,
Exhausting the utility of carriage and horses, 
Sapping the energy of officers and men, 
Wasting the wealth of treasures and storehouses,

beneficence: 
Striving only for selfish pleasure; 
Not caring for the common people, 
Ignoring the administration of the state, 
Craving only a catch of pheasants or hares,

“Looking at it from this perspective, are not the actions of Qi and Chu lamentable? Their territory does
not exceed a thousand leagues square, yet their parks occupy nine hundred of them. This means the
vegetation cannot be cleared, and the people have nothing to eat. If someone of the insignificance of a
vassal lord enjoys the extravagances fit only for an emperor, I fear the common people will suffer the ill
effects.”
Thereupon, the two gentlemen paled, changed expressions, and seemed dispirited and lost in thought.

Up north in Shuofang there were many bold plans, they say,
8 Only nowadays where is there a Guo Fenyang?"

2 I am skilled at playing Wu melodies and Chu songs.
The wild crane’s clearheaded because its bones are aged,
4 Mandarin ducks gray together because their love is deep.
Pendants worn at the waist are antiques a thousand years old,
6 The topsy-turvy script written when drunk are waves ten yards long.
Recently in making verse I have become more attentive,
8 When it comes to long lines every time I study Dongpo."

After ten days of drizzling rain and wisps of wind,
The misty scene of lush spring seems like remnants of autumn."

I don’t believe there could be a pathway ahead."

Again a crescent forms where it has waned?"

Love and Courtship",None,None,0,Weeping for Elder Sister,"In the clear night I still remember when we chatted quietly.
2 When you were alive, I feared we would part, with little chance to be
together.
In our inner chambers, how could we know we’d be separated by death?
4 In my heart, I could only pine for your visits home.
Sisters linking verses were like the best of friends,
6 I followed my companion, at dawn or dusk we embroidered together.
Now in front of the mirror I am startled to see myself standing alone,
8 Why must I see a pair of swallows fluttering by the curtains?"

In marrying, I take leave of my family and part from those I love.

2 My good friend excels in poems and songs. (Baihuang)
Fragrant tunes rise from the zithers,
4 The tinkling gems enhance the jadelike beauty. (Ruyu)
As the temple bell sounds amid hushed bamboos,
6 The moon’s reflection rises late on the curtain. (Baihuang)
You want to put all your efforts into the vocation of a thousand years,
8 Deep in the night, not yet gone to bed. (Ruyu)"

Hardship and Injustice
Love and Courtship",None,None,0,Recited at Random,"In leisure, I roll out a scroll and open the window,
2 A painting in hand, I face the twilight in the breeze.
The world seems small when one takes a broad view,
4 Looking back, one recognizes the mistakes of the past and present.
Only when I practice meditation do I realize an undefiled mind,
6 Only when I copy sutras do I know there’s a crucial point in the brush.
When the myriad sounds quiet down thoughts become tranquil,
8 The moon moves pure shadows onto the screen."

","The hills are quiet, just right for hot weather,
2 Wind through the pines enters into clear dreams.
Rain colors fly across precipitous cliffs,
4 On ancient trees sob the sound of cicadas.
Stitching embroidery has been my lesson in recent years,
6 Watching clouds—sentiments beyond phenomena.
If one does not know that the dusty world is faraway,
8 In vain one will try to prove No Rebirth."
